(Inside genMongoscripts.zip: generate_stores.py is a Python script which uses Faker to generate data for a collection of stores for a yelp-like website.

generate_store_queries.py generates MongoDB shell scripts (in JavaScript) to interact with the database.

get_ids.js retrieves object ID's after the database has been populated.

The stores.zip file is a sample result of running the script. These serve as an example that can help you generate the data you want for this assignment)
